                Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 200 million copies sold and over 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.[18]
            
                In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain,
                 and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items,
                 and build structures or earthworks. 
                 Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs,
                  as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and access to flight.
                 Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

                Caller's Bane (originally named Scrolls) is a strategy digital collectible card game developed by Mojang AB,
                 which aims to combine elements from trading card games and traditional board games. Scrolls was originally conceived and developed by Jakob Pors√©r,
                  who along with Mojang founder Markus Persson, intended to create a type of game that was currently missing from the market. 
                  The game is developed using the Unity game engine,[3] allowing it to run on multiple gaming platforms. Scrolls was announced on 2 March 2011, as Mojang's second game.
                  [1] While Mojang had claimed that they stopped development of the game in June 2015,
                   the company revealed that they had still been working on the project, and in June 2018,
                 released the game under its new title Caller's Bane for free.[4]
